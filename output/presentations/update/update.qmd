- [ ] Hydrological Model
- [ ] Statistical Analysis

## Literature

#### Externalities of Deforestation

- Logging has lead to an estimated emission of around 36 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions from 2001 to 2022 in Brazil alone [@worldresourcesinstituteGlobalForestWatch2023]
- Research suggest catastrophic biodiversity tipping points[@malhiClimateChangeDeforestation2008]
- Wildfires increase rates of pulmonary diseases [@reddingtonAirQualityHuman2015]
- Malaria incidence appears to be correlated with deforestation [@olsonDeforestationMalariaMancio2010]

#### Soil Erosion, River Pollution and Health Outcomes

- Soil properties are substantially altered after logging [@veldkampDeforestationReforestationImpacts2020]
- Increased erosion and agricultural use may deteriorate drinking water quality downstream [@maHumanHealthRisk2014]
- Studies estimate significant increase in defensive expenditures due to erosion [@clarkErodingSoilsOfffarm1985] 

## Data Acquisition

- Obtained data on 
  - Deforestation (annual, 30m-resolution maps)
  - River pollution (daily, >4000 sensor stations)
  - Child mortality (daily, by postcode)
  - Cloud coverage (annual, 90m-resolution maps)

#### Identification

- Monitoring is satellite-based (DETER project) [@nepstadSlowingAmazonDeforestation2014]
- Cloud cover as a potential instrument for deforestation

## Hydrological Model I

- Established a river model

## Statistical Analysis

- Descriptives and experiments with aggregation and weighting
- Exploring the correlation of deforestation and pollution readings at sensors
- Estimating panel- and spatial models with IV with health outcomes (Spatial-Lag/Durbin Model)
