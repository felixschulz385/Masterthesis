## Introduction

In this thesis, I investigate the impact of deforestation on water quality and health in Brazil. I use a combination of remote sensing data, water quality data, and health data to try to estimate the causal effect of deforestation on public health through soil erosion. The thesis is divided into two main parts. First, I build a vision transformer to evaluate the potential of using neural networks as student models to existing solutions as a cost-efficient alternative. In the second part I provide an econometric analysis of the impact of deforestation on water quality and mortality rates through soil erosion.

## About

This repository contains the full documentation, datasets, and codebase used in my research. In /code, you can find the modularized code used to process the data, run the analysis, and generate the figures. This project is notebook-first, meaning all code execution is performed from Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks are organized in a way that allows for easy reproducibility and understanding of the research process.
